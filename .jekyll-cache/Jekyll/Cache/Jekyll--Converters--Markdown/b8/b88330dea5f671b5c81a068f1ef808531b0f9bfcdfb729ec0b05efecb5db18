I"h<p>I started to hear about CDNs since I joined my current job. One of the CDNs we use is Fastly, it is being used in almost all of our projects so I got a brief introduction about it when I first joined the company. At that time I learned that Fastly was a Content Delivery Network that sits in front of every projectâ€™s infrastructure and handles cache.</p>
