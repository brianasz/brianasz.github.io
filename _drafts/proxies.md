So proxies....

In spanish... well, english, or for mortals like me....
A proxy is a transit server, it is an intermediary between me (the user) and the destination server (the website I'm trying to reach).
It's purpose is the change of IP address. Depending on which IP address is change, is the type of proxie we are talking about. 

Note: ISP is only your Internet Service Provider, it is always present, without it you wouldn't have internet connection.

Why would anyone use an intermediary?
1) To restrict access to a limited version of the internet. For example a schoool would limit the access to the internet to its students. 

2) To restric access to certain content.
